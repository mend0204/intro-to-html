      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <img src="images/IMG_5619.jpg" alt="Asian girl smiling" width="500">

      <p>What originally inspired me to apply to the Graphic Design program is a course I took back in high school that explored some of Adobe softwares like Illustrator and Photoshop. I was really good at it and had lots of fun doing it, I then found out that that course was something that I could do for a career.</p> 

      <p>I am still inspired by that same course in high school, I look back on it fondly as I really enjoy the program. But I also have gained more inspiration from the teachers who have taught me in the first semester and continue on getting inspired by my current professors.</p>
